aim: implement dynamic sorting for the result of post queries

obstacles:
  since the original code for representing the posts is directly from the graphql query result,
  it does not offer sorting functions.
   the current result is stored as
          public posts: ApolloQueryObservable<PostsInterface>;

 ideas:
  -watch a tutorial on graphql, find a way to change the result
  -perhaps we will need to convert the query result to objects first then do a dynamic sort on that.
  -initial sorting is needed too
  -ofcuz we can sort somehow by providing variables in query but considering the case where the user just want to sort the current result instead of making a new search,\
   dynamic sort makes more sense

  -the auto search is very likely to be a innner search based on the current result, which has nothing to do with reordering the result.
